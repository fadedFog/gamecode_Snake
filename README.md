# gamecode_Snake
 The game that won the hearts of players in the early 70's-snake. I tried to repeat the game, the game logic was received, but the interface is not yet available:D

The program starts from the Intellij IDEA development console. Movement keys-arrow keys. The outcome of the game is one. The game ends if the snake starts eating itself instead of the mouse,or tries to go out of bounds.
